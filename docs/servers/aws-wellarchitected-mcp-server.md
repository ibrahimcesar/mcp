## Generated ADRs

The server generates comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for each best practice:

### ADR Structure
- **Context**: Problem statement and current situation
- **Decision**: Recommended architectural decision
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Trade-offs**: Benefits vs. costs analysis
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered
- **Implementation Notes**: Specific guidance and steps

### Example ADR Output
```markdown
# ADR: Implement Infrastructure as Code

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Status:** Proposed
**Best Practice ID:** OPS01
**Pillar:** OPERATIONAL_EXCELLENCE
**Risk Level:** HIGH

## Context
Well-Architected Framework OPERATIONAL_EXCELLENCE pillar requires consistent and repeatable infrastructure provisioning...

## Decision
Implement Infrastructure as Code using AWS CloudFormation or CDK...

## Trade-offs
### Benefit
- Improved system reliability and maintainability
- Version-controlled infrastructure changes
- Reduced manual errors

### Cost
- Initial implementation effort
- Learning curve for team
- Ongoing maintenance overhead
```

## Risk Assessment

The server categorizes findings by risk level:

- ðŸ”´ **HIGH RISK**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM RISK**: Important improvements to plan and implement  
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW RISK**: Nice-to-have optimizations

## Implementation Guidance

For each non-compliant best practice, the server provides:

1. **Specific Steps**: Detailed implementation steps
2. **Prerequisites**: Required setup and permissions
3. **Success Criteria**: How to validate implementation
4. **Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring recommendations
5. **Effort Estimation**: Time and resource requirements

## Use Cases

### Architecture Review
Perform comprehensive reviews of existing architectures to identify improvement opportunities.

### Pre-Production Validation
Validate new architectures against Well-Architected principles before deployment.

### Compliance Documentation
Generate ADRs for compliance and audit purposes.

### Team Education
Use generated reports to educate teams on AWS best practices.

### Continuous Improvement
Regular reviews to maintain architectural excellence over time.

## Best Practices for Usage

1. **Provide Detailed Context**: Include comprehensive system descriptions for better analysis
2. **Include Documentation**: Reference existing documentation for completeness validation
3. **Focus Reviews**: Use pillar-specific reviews for targeted improvements
4. **Regular Reviews**: Perform reviews regularly as systems evolve
5. **Act on Findings**: Prioritize high-risk items for immediate attention

## Limitations

- Analysis is based on provided context and documentation
- Cannot directly inspect AWS resources (requires separate tooling)
- Recommendations are general and may need customization
- Best practices coverage focuses on core areas (not exhaustive)

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Well-Architected Review
  run: |
    python -c "
    import asyncio
    from awslabs.aws_wellarchitected_mcp_server.server import review
    
    result = asyncio.run(review(
        context='${{ env.SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION }}',
        output_directory='./wa-review'
    ))
    print(f'Review completed: {result}')
    "
```

### Documentation Generation
Use the server to automatically generate architecture documentation and decision records as part of your documentation pipeline.

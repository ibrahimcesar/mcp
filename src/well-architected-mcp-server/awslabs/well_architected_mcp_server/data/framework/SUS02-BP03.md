# SUS02-BP03 Stop the creation and maintenance of unused assets

Decommission unused assets in your workload to reduce
the number of cloud resources required to support your
demand and minimize waste.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You do not analyze your application for assets that are redundant or no longer required.
- You do not remove assets that are redundant or no longer required.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:** Removing
unused assets frees resources and improves the overall efficiency of the workload.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Low

## Implementation guidance

Unused assets consume cloud resources like storage space and compute power. By identifying and eliminating these assets, you can free up these resources, resulting in a more efficient cloud architecture. Perform regular analysis on application assets such as pre-compiled reports, datasets, static images, and asset access patterns to identify redundancy, underutilization, and potential decommission targets. Remove those redundant assets to reduce the resource waste in your workload.

### Implementation steps

- **Conduct an inventory:** Conduct a comprehensive inventory to identify all assets within your workload.
- **Analyze usage:** Use continuous monitoring to identify static assets that are no longer required.
- **Remove unused assets:** Develop a plan to remove assets that are no longer required.

Before removing any asset, evaluate the impact of removing it on the architecture.
- Consolidate overlapping generated assets to remove redundant processing.
- Update your applications to no longer produce and store assets that are not required.

- **Communicate with third parties:** Instruct third parties to stop producing and storing assets managed on your behalf that are no longer required. Ask to consolidate redundant assets.
- **Use lifecycle policies:** Use lifecycle policies to automatically delete unused assets.

You can use [Amazon S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) to manage your objects throughout their lifecycle.
- You can use [Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshot-lifecycle.html) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of Amazon EBS snapshots and Amazon EBS-backed AMIs.

- **Review and optimize:** Regularly review your workload to identify and remove any unused assets.

# SEC11-BP04 Conduct code reviews

Implement code reviews to help verify the quality and security of
software being developed. Code reviews involve having team members
other than the original code author review the code for potential
issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards and best
practices. This process helps catch errors, inconsistencies, and
security flaws that might have been overlooked by the original
developer. Use automated tools to assist with code reviews.

**Desired outcome:** You include code
reviews during development to increase the quality of the software
being written. You upskill less experienced members of the team
through learnings identified during the code review. You identify
opportunities for automation and support the code review process
using automated tools and testing.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You don't review code before deployment.
- The same person writes and reviews the code.
- You don't use automation and tools to assist or orchestrate code
reviews.
- You don't train builders on application security before they
review code.

**Benefits of establishing this best practice:**

- Increased code quality.
- Increased consistency of code development through reuse of
common approaches.
- Reduction in the number of issues discovered during
penetration testing and later stages.
- Improved knowledge transfer within the team.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:**
Medium

## Implementation guidance

Code reviews help to verify the quality and security of the
software during development. Manual reviews involve having a team
member other than the original code author review the code for
potential issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding
standards and best practices. This process helps catch errors,
inconsistencies, and security flaws that might have been
overlooked by the original developer.

Consider [Amazon CodeGuru Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html)
to help conduct automated code reviews. CodeGuru Security uses
machine learning and automated reasoning to analyze your code and
identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding issues.
Integrate automated code reviews with your existing code
repositories and continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines.

### Implementation steps

- **Establish a code review
process:**

Define when code reviews should occur, such as before
merging code into the main branch or before deploying to
production.
- Determine who should be involved in the code review
process, such as team members, senior developers, and
security experts.
- Decide on the code review methodology, including the
process and tools to be used.

- **Set up code review tools:**

Evaluate and select code review tools that fit your
team's needs, such as GitHub Pull Requests or CodeGuru
Security
- Integrate the chosen tools with your existing code
repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
- Configure the tools to enforce code review requirements,
such as the minimum number of reviewers and approval
rules.

- **Define a code review checklist and
guidelines:**

Create a code review checklist or guidelines that
outline what should be reviewed. Consider factors such
as code quality, security vulnerabilities, adherence to
coding standards, and performance.
- Share the checklist or guidelines with the development
team, and verify everyone understands the expectations.

- **Train developers on code review best
practices:**

Provide training to your team on how to conduct
effective code reviews.
- Educate your team on application security principles and
common vulnerabilities to look for during reviews.
- Encourage knowledge sharing and pair programming
sessions to upskill less experienced team members.

- **Implement the code review
process:**

Integrate the code review step into your development
workflow, such as creating a pull request and assigning
reviewers.
- Require that code changes undergo a code review before
merge or deployment.
- Encourage open communication and constructive feedback
during the review process.

- **Monitor and improve:**

Regularly review the effectiveness of your code review
process and gather feedback from the team.
- Identify opportunities for automation or tool
improvements to streamline the code review process.
- Continuously update and refine the code review checklist
or guidelines based on learnings and industry best
practices.

- **Foster a culture of code
review:**

Emphasize the importance of code reviews to maintain
code quality and security.
- Celebrate successes and learnings from the code review
process.
- Encourage a collaborative and supportive environment
where developers feel comfortable giving and receiving
feedback.

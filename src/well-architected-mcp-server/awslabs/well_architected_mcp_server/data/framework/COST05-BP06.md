# COST05-BP06 Perform cost analysis for different usage over time

Workloads can change over time. Some services or features are more
cost effective at different usage levels. By performing the analysis
on each component over time and at projected usage, the workload
remains cost-effective over its lifetime.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

As AWS releases new services and features, the optimal services for your workload may
change. Effort required should reflect potential benefits. Workload review frequency
depends on your organization requirements. If it is a workload of significant cost,
implementing new services sooner will maximize cost savings, so more frequent review can
be advantageous. Another initiation for review is change in usage patterns. Significant changes
in usage can indicate that alternate services would be more optimal.

If you need to move data into AWS Cloud, you can select any wide variety of services AWS
offers and partner tools to help you migrate your data sets, whether they are files,
databases, machine images, block volumes, or even tape backups. For example, to move a
large amount of data to and from AWS or process data at the edge, you can use one of
the AWS purpose-built devices to cost effectively move petabytes of data offline.
Another example is for higher data transfer rates, a direct connect service may be
cheaper than a VPN which provides the required consistent connectivity for your
business.

Based on the cost analysis for different usage over time, review your scaling activity.
Analyze the result to see if the scaling policy can be tuned to add instances with multiple
instance types and purchase options. Review your settings to see if the minimum can be
reduced to serve user requests but with a smaller fleet size, and add more resources to
meet the expected high demand.

Perform cost analysis for different usage over time by discussing with stakeholders in
your organization and use [AWS Cost Explorer’s](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-forecast.html) forecast feature to predict the potential
impact of service changes. Monitor usage level launches using AWS Budgets, CloudWatch
billing alarms and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to identify and implement the most cost-effective
services sooner.

**Implementation steps**

- **Define predicted usage patterns:**Working with your
organization, such as marketing and product owners, document what the expected and
predicted usage patterns will be for the workload. Discuss with business stakeholders
about both historical and forecasted cost and usage increases and make sure increases
align with business requirements. Identify calendar days, weeks, or months where you
expect more users to use your AWS resources, which indicate that you should increase
the capacity of the existing resources or adopt additional services to reduce the cost
and increase performance.
- **Perform cost analysis at predicted usage:** Using the usage
patterns defined, perform analysis at each of these points. The analysis effort should reflect
the potential outcome. For example, if the change in usage is large, a thorough analysis should
be performed to verify any costs and changes. In other words, when cost increases, usage should
increase for business as well.

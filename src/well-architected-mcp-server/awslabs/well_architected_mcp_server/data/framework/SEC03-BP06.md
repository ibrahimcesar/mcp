# SEC03-BP06 Manage access based on lifecycle

Monitor and adjust the permissions granted to your principals
(users, roles, and groups) throughout their lifecycle within your
organization. Adjust group memberships as users change roles, and
remove access when a user leaves the organization.

**Desired outcome:** You monitor and
adjust permissions throughout the lifecycle of principals within the
organization, reducing risk of unnecessary privileges. You grant
appropriate access when you create a user. You modify access as the
user's responsibilities change, and you remove access when the user
is no longer active or has left the organization. You centrally
manage changes to your users, roles, and groups. You use automation
to propagate changes to your AWS environments.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Granting excessive or broad access privileges to identities
upfront, beyond what is initially required.
- Not reviewing and adjusting access privileges as identities'
roles and responsibilities change over time.
- Leaving inactive or terminated identities with active access
privileges. This increases the risk of unauthorized access.
- Not leveraging automation to manage the lifecycle of identities.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Carefully manage and adjust access privileges that you grant to
identities (such as users, roles, groups) throughout their
lifecycle. This lifecycle includes the initial onboarding phase,
ongoing changes in roles and responsibilities, and eventual
offboarding or termination. Proactively manage access based on the
stage of the lifecycle to maintain the appropriate access level.
Adhere to the principle of least privilege to reduce the risk of
excessive or unnecessary access Privileges.

You can manage the lifecycle of IAM users directly within the AWS account, or through federation from your workforce identity
provider to
[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/). For IAM users, you can create, modify,
and delete users and their associated permissions within the AWS account. For federated users, you can use IAM Identity Center to
manage their lifecycle by synchronizing user and group information
from your organization's identity provider using the
[System
for Cross-domain Identity Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html) (SCIM) protocol.

SCIM is an open standard protocol for automated provisioning and
deprovisioning of user identities across different systems. By
integrating your identity provider with IAM Identity Center using
SCIM, you can automatically synchronize user and group
information, helping to validate that access privileges are
granted, modified, or revoked based on changes in your
organization's authoritative identity source.

As the roles and responsibilities of employees change within your
organization, adjust their access privileges accordingly. You can
use IAM Identity Center's permission sets to define different job
roles or responsibilities and associate them with the appropriate
IAM policies and permissions. When an employee's role changes, you
can update their assigned permission set to reflect their new
responsibilities. Verify that they have the necessary access while
adhering to the principle of least privilege.

### Implementation steps

- Define and document an access management lifecycle process,
including procedures for granting initial access, periodic
reviews, and offboarding.
- Implement
[IAM
roles, groups, and permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) to manage
access collectively and enforce maximum permissible access
levels.
- Integrate with a
[federated
identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html) (such as Microsoft Active
Directory, Okta, Ping Identity) as the authoritative source
for user and group information using IAM Identity Center.
- Use the
[SCIM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html)
protocol to synchronize user and group information from the
identity provider into IAM Identity Center's Identity Store.
- Create
[permission
sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html) in IAM Identity Center that represent different
job roles or responsibilities within your organization.
Define the appropriate IAM policies and permissions for each
permission set.
- Implement regular access reviews, prompt access revocation,
and continuous improvement of the access management
lifecycle process.
- Provide training and awareness to employees on access
management best practices.

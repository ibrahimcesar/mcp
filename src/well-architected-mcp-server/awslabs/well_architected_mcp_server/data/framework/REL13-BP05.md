# REL13-BP05 Automate recovery

Implement tested and automated recovery mechanisms that are
reliable, observable, and reproducible to reduce the risk and
business impact of failure.

**Desired outcome:** You have
implemented a well-documented, standardized, and thoroughly-tested
automation workflow for recovery processes. Your recovery automation
automatically corrects minor issues that pose low risk of data loss
or unavailability. You are able to quickly invoke recovery processes
for serious incidents, observe the remediation behavior while they
operate, and end the processes if you observe dangerous situations
or failures.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- You depend on components or mechanisms that are in a failed or
degraded state as part of your recovery plan.
- Your recovery processes require manual intervention, such as
console access (also known as *click ops*).
- You automatically initiate recovery procedures in situations
that present a high risk of data loss or unavailability.
- You fail to include a mechanism to abort a recovery procedure
(like an *Andon cord* or *big red
stop button*) that is not working or that poses
additional risks.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:**

- Increased reliability, predictability, and consistency of
recovery operations.
- Ability to meet more stringent recovery objectives, including
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO).
- Reduced likelihood of recovery failing during an incident.
- Reduced risk of failures associated with manual recovery
processes that are prone to human error.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

To implement automated recovery, you need a comprehensive approach
that uses AWS services and best practices. To start, identify
critical components and potential failure points in your workload.
Develop automated processes that can recover your workloads and
data from failures without human intervention.

Develop your recovery automation using infrastructure as code
(IaC) principles. This makes your recovery environment consistent
with the source environment and allows for version control of your
recovery processes. To orchestrate complex recovery workflows,
consider solutions such as
[AWS Systems Manager Automations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) or
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

Automation of recovery processes provides significant benefits and
can help you more easily achieve your Recovery Time Objective
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). However, they can
encounter unexpected situations that may cause them to fail or
create new risks of their own such as additional downtime and data
loss. To mitigate this risk, provide the ability to quickly halt a
recovery automation in progress. Once halted, you can investigate
and take corrective steps.

For supported workloads, consider solutions such as AWS Elastic
Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to provide automated failover. AWS DRS
continually replicates your machines (including operating system,
system state configuration, databases, applications, and files)
into a staging area in your target AWS account and preferred
Region. If an incident occurs, AWS DRS automates the conversion of
your replicated servers into fully-provisioned workloads in your
recovery Region on AWS.

Maintenance and improvement of automated recovery is an ongoing
process. Continually test and refine your recovery procedures
based on lessons learned, and stay updated on new AWS services and
features that can enhance your recovery capabilities.

### Implementation steps

- **Plan for automated
recovery**

Conduct a thorough review of your workload architecture,
components, and dependencies to identify and plan
automated recovery mechanisms. Categorize your
workload's dependencies into *hard*
and *soft* dependencies. Hard
dependencies are those that the workload cannot operate
without and for which no substitute can be provided.
Soft dependencies are those that the workload ordinarily
uses but are replaceable with temporary substitute
systems or processes or can be handled by
[graceful
degradation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation).
- Establish processes to identify and recover missing or
corrupted data.
- Define steps to confirm a recovered steady state after
recovery actions have been completed.
- Consider any actions required to make the recovered
system ready for full service, such as pre-warming and
populating caches.
- Consider problems that could be encountered during the
recovery process and how to detect and remediate them.
- Consider scenarios where the primary site and its
control plane are inaccessible. Verify that recovery
actions can be performed independently without reliance
on the primary site. Consider solutions such as
[Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/) to
redirect traffic without the need to manually mutate DNS
records.

- **Develop automated recovery
process**

Implement automated fault detection and failover
mechanisms for hands-free recovery. Build dashboards
such as with
[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to report the progress and health of
automated recovery procedures. Include procedures to
validate successful recovery. Provide a mechanism to
abort a recovery in process.
- Build
[playbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_testing_resiliency_playbook_resiliency)
as a fallback process for faults that cannot be
automatically recovered from, and take into
consideration your
[disaster
recovery plan](https://aws.amazon.com/disaster-recovery/faqs/#Core_concepts).
- Test recovery processes as discussed in
[REL13-BP03](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_planning_for_recovery_dr_tested.html).

- **Prepare for recovery**

Evaluate the state of your recovery site and deploy
critical components to it in advance. For more detail,
see
[REL13-BP04](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_config_drift.html).
- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and
decision-making processes for recovery operations,
involving relevant stakeholders and teams across the
organization.
- Define the conditions to initiate your recovery
processes.
- Create a plan to revert the recovery process and fall
back to your primary site if required or after it's
considered safe.

# SUS06-BP02 Adopt methods that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements

Adopt methods and processes to validate potential improvements,
minimize testing costs, and deliver small improvements.

**Common anti-patterns:**

- Reviewing your application for sustainability is a task done
only once at the beginning of a project.
- Your workload has become stale, as the release process is too
cumbersome to introduce minor changes for resource efficiency.
- You do not have mechanisms to improve your workload for
sustainability.

**Benefits of establishing this best
practice:** By establishing a process to introduce and
track sustainability improvements, you will be able to continually
adopt new features and capabilities, remove issues, and improve
workload efficiency.

**Level of risk exposed if this best practice
is not established:** Medium

## Implementation guidance

Test and validate potential sustainability improvements before
deploying them to production. Account for the cost of testing when
calculating potential future benefit of an improvement. Develop
low cost testing methods to deliver small improvements.

### Implementation steps

- **Understand and communicate your
organizational sustainability goals:** Understand
your organizational sustainability goals, such carbon
reduction or water stewardship. Translate these goals into
sustainability requirements for your cloud workloads.
Communicate these requirements to key stakeholders.
- **Add sustainability requirements to
your backlog:** Add requirements for sustainability
improvement to your development backlog.
- **Iterate and improve:** Use an
[iterative
improvement process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/improvement-process.html) to identify, evaluate, prioritize,
test, and deploy these improvements.
- **Test using minimum viable product
(MVP):** Develop and test potential improvements
using the minimum viable representative components to reduce
the cost and environmental impact of testing.
- **Streamline the process:**
Continually improve and streamline your development processes.
As an example, Automate your software delivery process using
continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to test
and deploy potential improvements to reduce the level of
effort and limit errors caused by manual processes.
- **Training and awareness:** Run
training programs for your team members to educate them about
sustainability and how their activities impact your
organizational sustainability goals.
- **Assess and adjust:**
Continually assess the impact of improvements and make
adjustments as needed.

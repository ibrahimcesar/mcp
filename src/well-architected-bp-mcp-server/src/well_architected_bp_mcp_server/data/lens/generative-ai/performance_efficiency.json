    "description": "Ground truth data facilitates model testing for use case specific scenarios and should be developed and curated for generative AI workloads. Ground truth data, also known as a golden dataset, is data classified to be true and is vital for the efficient testing of data-driven workloads, particularly generative AI workloads. Ground truth data for generative AI traditionally consists of a prompt and a desirable response to said prompt. For prompts that supplement responses with data from external sources, customers can extend the ground truth data to include source documentation or other useful metadata.",
